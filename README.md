# OOP-BlackJack
My learning process into Object Oriented Programming while I develop a  card game named Black Jack (21) , very popular in Casinos around the world 


Abstraction: Based on how the game works, I indetified these classes and atributes:

    - Player
        . Name
        . Hand
        . Points
        
    - Dealer ( inherits from Player )
        . Baralho
        
After identifying the first classes and atributes i started to build the main menu, using a 'while' loop to choose between all the options. Each options corresponds to a number and depending on the number, the code enters in a specific loop based on the option the user chose
